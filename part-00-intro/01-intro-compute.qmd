### Accessing Colab

1. Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account 
3. Click "New Notebook" to create your first Colab notebook

### Understanding the interface

The Colab interface is similar to Jupyter notebooks, with a few key components:

- **Menu Bar**: Contains File, Edit, View, Insert, Runtime, Tools, and Help options
- **Toolbar**: Quick access to common actions like adding code/text cells
- **Cell Area**: Where you write and execute code or text 
- **Runtime Status**: Shows the state of your notebook's connection to Google's servers

### Basic operations

1. **Creating Cells**:
   - Code cells: Click "+ Code" or use Ctrl+M B
   - Text cells: Click "+ Text" or use Ctrl+M M

2. **Running Cells**:
   - Click the play button next to the cell
   - Use Shift+Enter 
   - Select Runtime > Run all from the menu

3. **Cell Types**:
   - Code cells: For Python code execution
   - Text cells: For documentation (supports Markdown)

### Important features

1. **Runtime Type**:
   - Click Runtime > Change runtime type
   - Select Python 3 as the runtime
   - For GPU access: Change hardware accelerator to GPU when needed

2. **File Management**:
   - Files uploaded to Colab are temporary
   - Connect to Google Drive for persistent storage:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

3. **Package Installation:**

Install additional packages using:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## conda
```python
# add a -c conda-forge to select the conda-forge channel
# add a -q flag to install quietly (reduced output)
# add a -y flag to prememptively accept other changes
!conda install package_name
```
## pip
```python
!pip install package_name
```
:::

### Best practices

1. Save Your Work:
   - Regularly save to Google Drive (File > Save a copy in Drive)
   - Download important notebooks locally as backups
   
2. Resource Management:
   - Close unused notebooks to free up resources
   - Be aware of idle timeouts (notebooks disconnect after extended inactivity)

3. Memory Usage:

Look for this icon to indicate where you can click to access Gemini in Colab.
:::

Here are a few ways you can use Google Gemini effectively in Colab:

### Chat support

Click the "Gemini" button in the top-right corner to open a chat interface where you can ask questions about your code, debug issues, or get explanations of concepts. This option is especially useful for beginners or for complex problems.

### Code generation

Use the "Generate code" option (the sparkle icon) above any **empty** code cell to generate new code based on your description. You can ask it to many different things including:

- Loading a dataset called `my_data.csv`
- Plot a histogram of the data
- Build a model to predict `y` from `X`

### Code explanation

Use the "Explain code" option (the sparkle icon) above any **complete** code cell to open a chat interface that will automatically explain the code in the cell. This is useful for understanding code written by someone else, learning new concepts you are not familiar with, or getting a second opinion on your work.

### Code completion

Colab provides intelligent autocomplete as you type:

- Press Tab to accept suggestions
- Use Ctrl+Space (Cmd+Space on Mac) to manually trigger suggestions
- Get real-time documentation and parameter hints

::: {.callout-note}
While these AI tools are helpful, always review and understand the code they suggest before using it in your work.

## Accessing course notebooks

All course notebooks are hosted on GitHub and can be accessed directly in Google Colab. There are two ways to access the notebooks:

### Method 1: Direct links

Each section of this book includes direct "Open in Colab" links for relevant notebooks. Simply click the badge to open the notebook:

Example [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/PlanetaryComputerExamples/blob/main/tutorials/mosaiks.ipynb)

### Method 2: Clone the notebook

To choose a notebook from the repository (Add link to demo/interactive notebooks here):

1. Open Google Colab (colab.research.google.com)
2. Click `File > Open Notebook`
3. Select the `GitHub` tab
4. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/[username]/[repo]` (UPDATE WITH REPO)
5. Select the notebook you want to open

### Saving your work

When you open a notebook from GitHub in Colab, it creates a temporary copy. To save your work:

1. Click `File > "Save a copy in Drive"`
2. This creates your own editable copy in your Google Drive
3. All future changes will be saved to your copy

### Notebook organization

The course notebooks are organized into:  

- `demos/`: Complete demonstration notebooks
- `exercises/`: Interactive notebooks with exercises to complete
- `solutions/`: Complete versions of exercise notebooks

Each notebook includes:  

- Clear instructions in markdown cells
- Code cells with examples or exercises
- TO DO sections for exercises
- Validation cells to check your work

## Data access and management

There are several ways to access data in Colab notebooks. Here are the main approaches:

### Direct downloads 

For data hosted on repositories like Zenodo, you can download directly using wget:

```python
# Set the data directory
data_dir = "LSMS-ISA-data"

# Download the data
!wget https://zenodo.org/records/14040658/files/Data.zip

# Unzip and organize
!unzip Data.zip
!mv Data {data_dir}
!rm Data.zip
```

### Google Drive integration

For data stored in Google Drive:

1. First mount your Google Drive:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

2. Access your data using the mounted path:

```python
drive_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/project_folder"
```

3. For better performance, copy data to local VM storage:

::: {.callout-note}
Remember that the VM's storage is temporary - files will be deleted when the runtime disconnects. Always keep a backup of your data in Drive or another permanent storage location.
:::

```python
import os
import shutil

# Create local directory
local_dir = "/content/data/"
os.makedirs(local_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Copy data from Drive to VM
drive_data = os.path.join(drive_path, "my_data") 
shutil.copytree(drive_data, local_dir, dirs_exist_ok=True)
```

### Why copy data to the VM?

When working with data in Colab, copying files from Google Drive to the virtual machine (VM) can significantly improve performance:

1. **Faster Access**: Reading directly from Google Drive requires data to be transferred over the network for each operation. Local VM storage provides much faster read/write speeds.

2. **Reduced Latency**: Network latency between Colab and Google Drive can slow down operations that require multiple data accesses. Local data eliminates this latency.

3. **More Reliable**: Network connectivity issues or Drive access problems won't interrupt your analysis once data is copied locally.

4. **Better for Iterative Processing**: If your code needs to read the same data multiple times (like in machine learning training loops), local access is much more efficient.

For example, reading a 1GB dataset from Drive might take 30 seconds, while reading from local VM storage could take just a few seconds. The time spent copying data once at the start of your session can save significant time during analysis. This can be especially true in a notebook environment when a user is developing code and may need to access and reaccess the data multiple times.
