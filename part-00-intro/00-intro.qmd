## Overview

This section introduces the fundamental concepts of MOSAIKS (Multi-task Observation using Satellite Imagery & Kitchen Sinks) and provides practical guidance for getting started with the system. Whether you're new to satellite imagery analysis or an experienced practitioner, understanding these foundations is crucial for effectively utilizing MOSAIKS in your work.

MOSAIKS bridges the gap between the vast potential of satellite imagery and practical applications by providing:

- Accessible machine learning tools for non-experts
- Computationally efficient predictions
- Flexible applications across diverse tasks
- Scalable solutions for global challenges

## When to use MOSAIKS

MOSAIKS is particularly valuable when you need to:

- Generate predictions across large geographic areas
- Work with limited computational resources
- Analyze multiple outcomes using the same imagery
- Create predictions without deep learning expertise
- Scale analysis from local to global applications

However, MOSAIKS may not be the best choice when:

- You need predictions at sub-kilometer resolution
- Your outcome requires specific spectral bands
- Real-time predictions are essential
- Your application requires interpretable features

## Section outline

The following chapters will guide you through getting started with MOSAIKS:

| Chapter | Key Topics |
|---------|:-----------|
| @sec-intro-compute | Google Colab, data management, implementation practices |
| @sec-intro-mosaiks | Core concepts, system architecture, capabilities |
| @sec-intro-api | API access, data products, authentication |
| @sec-mosaiks-demo-1 | Basic workflow, example analysis, common pitfalls |
