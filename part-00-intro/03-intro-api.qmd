## Introduction

At its core, MOSAIKS requires two main inputs: satellite features and ground truth data. Our aim is to make these features as accessible as possible so that the majority of users do not have to worry about the technical details of satellite imagery processing.

To this end, we have worked to develop multiple ways to access MOSAIKS features:

| **Option** | **Imagery Source** | **Spatial Coverage** | **Spatial Resolution** | **Temporal Resolution** | **Link** | 
|------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| MOSAIKS API | Planet imagery| Global land areas | 0.01°, 0.1°, 1°, ADM2, ADM1, ADM0 | 2019 Q3 (static layer)| [MOSAIKS API](https://api.mosaiks.org/) | 
| Rolf et al 2021 | Google Earth basemap | Continental United States (~100k locations) | 0.01° | 2019 (static layer) | [Code Ocean Capsule](https://codeocean.com/capsule/6456296/tree/v2) | 
| Compute features | Any imagery source  | User-defined | User-defined | User-defined | @sec-features-computing |   |

The first part of this book focuses on the MOSAIKS API and publicly available features. The second part will cover how to compute features from your own imagery.
:::

The MOSAIKS API should be considered the primary way to access features. It is a user-friendly interface that allows you to download features for any location on Earth. The API is designed to be accessible to users with a range of technical backgrounds, from beginners to experts. However, there are many settings where users will want or need to compute their own customized features. @sec-features-computing guides readers through this process.

## API Overview

[api.mosaiks.org](https://api.mosaiks.org/)
:::

We have put together a [Resource Page](https://api.mosaiks.org/portal/resources/) for MOSAIKS users (registration required), which includes example Python and R notebooks for using the pipeline.

Don’t forget to see our [Tutorial Page](https://www.mosaiks.org/tutorials), which has an example Python notebook that we walk through in the video.

If you are looking for new data sets that we create using MOSAIKS (not features), we will be posting those [here](https://www.mosaiks.org/data-sets) as they become available.

### Register for an account

Visit [api.mosaiks.org](https://api.mosaiks.org/).

![Login page](../images/api-home.png)

Select `Register` to create an account. You'll need to provide:

![Registration page](../images/api-register.png)

Once registered, you can log in to access the MOSAIKS features and begin downloading data.

### Downloading features 

The MOSAIKS features are organized using a 0.01 x 0.01 degree latitude-longitude global grid, centered at .005 degree intervals.

When you download features, you'll receive them in a tabular .csv format where:

- Each row represents a unique grid cell
- The first two columns contain latitude and longitude coordinates
- The remaining columns represent K features (currently K = 4000 features)

Important notes about downloads:

- Files remain available for download for 15 days
- After 15 days, files are automatically deleted from the system
- There is a limit of 100,000 records per query

#### Ways to query features

There are two main methods to obtain features through the API:

1. **Map Query**
- Create rectangular boxes by specifying latitude and longitude coordinates
- Multiple boxes can be created
- The system displays an estimated number of records for each box
- Note that estimates are based on box area and may not reflect actual record numbers, especially for areas containing seas and oceans

2. **File Query** 
- Submit a file with custom latitude and longitude coordinates
- The API returns features for grid cells closest to your input coordinates
- Points are allocated to the nearest grid point if they don't exactly match
- The output file may have a different number of rows than your input
- Point ordering may change in the output

## Using MOSAIKS features for prediction

::: {.callout-tip}
This is a brief overview. Detailed instructions appear later in the manual (#sec-model-choice).
:::

Basic workflow:

1. Obtain ground truth measurements ("labels")
2. Download matching features via Map/File Query (or the pre-computed global-scale features at administrative boundary scale)
3. Spatially merge labels and features
4. Use regression to model relationship between imagery and outcome
5. Use regression results to predict outcome in new locations

You can experiment with various machine learning approaches in the regression step. For beginners, we recommend starting with our example Jupyter notebook (@sec-mosaiks-demo-1) that demonstrates a simple ridge regression approach (suitable for both R and Python users).

![Using MOSAIKS, a simplified workflow design.](../images/mosaiks-overview.png)

This topic will be covered in greater depth in later chapters. In the next chapter, you will see a simple MOSAIKS workflow which starts from the point of having both features from the API and ground truth labels.
