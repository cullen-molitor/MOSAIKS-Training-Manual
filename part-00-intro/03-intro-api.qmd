## Introduction

::: {.callout-tip}
Chapters @sec-intro-compute through @sec-labels-demo will focus on publicly available features and label data. Chapters @sec-satellite-imagery through @sec-features-demo will cover how to compute features from imagery.
:::

At its core, MOSAIKS requires two main inputs: satellite features and ground truth data. Our aim is to make these features as accessible as possible so that the majority of users do not have to worry about the technical details of satellite imagery processing.

To this end, we have worked to develop multiple ways to access MOSAIKS features:

| Option | Imagery Source | Spatial Coverage | Spatial Resolution | Temporal Resolution | Weighting | 
|--------|----------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| [MOSAIKS API](https://api.mosaiks.org/) | [Planet Labs Visual Basemap](https://developers.planet.com/docs/data/visual-basemaps/) | Global land areas | 0.01° | 2019 Q3 | Unweighted | 
| [MOSAIKS API](https://api.mosaiks.org/portal/global_grids/) | [Planet Labs Visual Basemap](https://developers.planet.com/docs/data/visual-basemaps/) | Global land areas | 0.1°, 1° | 2019 Q3 | Area & population | 
| [MOSAIKS API](https://api.mosaiks.org/portal/precomputed/) | [Planet Labs Visual Basemap](https://developers.planet.com/docs/data/visual-basemaps/) | Global land areas | ADM0, ADM1, ADM2 | 2019 Q3 | Area & population | 
| [Rolf et al 2021](https://codeocean.com/capsule/6456296/tree/v2) | [Google Static Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/start) | Continental United States (~100k locations) | 0.01° | 2019 | unweighted | 
| @sec-features-computing | Any - see @sec-satellite-imagery  | User-defined | User-defined | User-defined | User-defined | 

: Summary of MOSAIKS feature sources {#tbl-features-options}

The MOSAIKS API should be considered the primary way to access features. It is a user-friendly interface that allows you to download features for any location on Earth. The API is designed to be accessible to users with a range of technical backgrounds, from beginners to experts. For more details on what features are available on the API, see @sec-features-api.

However, there are many settings where users will want or need to compute their own customized features. @sec-features-computing guides readers through this process.

### API Features 

Currently the MOSAIKS API has a single set of global features (with several aggregation levels). The features are freely available to the public for download; this is the fastest and easiest way to begin using MOSAIKS. 

The API features use input imagery from Planet Labs, Inc. [Visual Basemap](https://developers.planet.com/docs/basemaps/) Global Quarterly 2019 (quarter 3) product. Image quality, and therefore  feature quality, may be affected by local conditions. For example, an area undergoing a rainy season in the third quarter (July to September), is likely to contain image artifacts from cloud cover. This will in turn effect the feature calculations. For more details on the input imagery @sec-satellite-imagery.

Given the static nature of the API, the easiest way to get started with MOSAIKS is to have label data for a recent time period (ideally from 2019 for fast changing labels, or a close year for more steady labels). To use MOSAIKS for time series data is possible, just not currently with precomputed and publicly available features. For more information on the API features see @sec-features-api

### Downloading features 

The MOSAIKS features are organized using a 0.01 x 0.01 degree latitude-longitude global grid. For simplicity, we store these features in a tabular format with latitude and longitude coordinates. These coordinates are the center of each grid cell.

When you download features, you'll receive them in a tabular .csv format where:

- Each row represents a unique grid cell
- The first two columns contain latitude and longitude coordinates
- The remaining columns represent *K* features (currently *K* = 4000 features)

Important notes about downloads:

- Files remain available for download for 15 days
- After 15 days, files are automatically deleted from the system
- There is a limit of *N* = 100,000 records per query

#### Feature query

The file query and map query are the two methods to obtain the high resolution (0.01 degree) features through the API.

1. **Map Query**
- Create rectangular boxes by specifying latitude and longitude coordinates
- Multiple boxes can be created
- The system displays an estimated number of records for each box
- Note that estimates are based on box area and may not reflect actual record numbers, especially for areas containing seas and oceans

2. **File Query** 
- Submit a file with custom latitude and longitude coordinates
- The API returns features for grid cells closest to your input coordinates
- Points are allocated to the nearest grid point if they don't exactly match
- The output file may have a different number of rows than your input
- Point ordering may change in the output

![API Map Query (left) and File Query (right)](../images/api-map-n-file.png){#fig-api-queries}

#### Aggregated feature files

Many users may find it easier to work with features aggregated to some level. The MOSAIKS API offers pre-aggregated features to accommodate these users need. Features come at several levels, including larger grid cells (0.1 and 1 degree) or summarized to administrative boundaries (ADM0, ADM1, and ADM2). These files are available for download as either single or chunked files depending on the resolution.

These pre-aggregated features are particularly useful for users in a few scenarios:

1. You have data at a scale larger than the 0.01 degree grid cells. Many datasets come at the country, state, or county level. 

1. Your data has a lot of noise that can be smoothed out by aggregating to a larger scale. A common example of this might be household survey data that is noisy at the individual level but smooths out when aggregated to the village or district level.

1. You want to do global analysis and don't have the computational resources to work with the full 0.01 degree grid cells.

::: {.callout-tip}
If you want to make high resolution predictions, with low resolution label data, you can build your model with aggregated features and use the high resolution features to make predictions. 
:::

In all cases using the pre-aggregated features can save you time and computational resources. 

> **Scenario:** You are working with a Living Standards Measurement Study - Integrated Surveys on Agriculture ([LSMS-ISA](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/lsms/initiatives/lsms-ISA)). This dataset has survey data with geographic coordinates at the household level. To protect, the privacy of the respondents, the data is jittered within a 5 km radius but it always remains within local administrative boundaries. You can therefore summarize your labels to the administrative units and build a model with the aggregated features. 

![Example showing of 3 representative random convolutional features (rows). Features are downloaded from the MOSAIKS API at 0.01° resolution (the native resolution) and aggregated to 3 levels, including (A) larger grid cells (0.1°), (B) counties, and (C) states.](../images/US_feature_summaries.png){#fig-api-aggregated}

## Using MOSAIKS features for prediction

::: {.callout-tip}
This is a brief overview. Detailed instructions appear later in the manual (@sec-model-choice).
:::

Basic workflow:

1. Obtain ground truth measurements ("labels"; see @sec-labels-100-maps)
2. Download matching features via Map Query, File Query, or one the pre-aggregated layers administrative boundary scale (see @sec-features-api for more details).
3. Spatially merge labels and features (see @sec-labels-data-prep)
4. Use regression to model relationship between imagery and outcome (see @sec-model-choice)
5. Use regression results to predict outcome in new locations (see @sec-model-choice)

You can experiment with various machine learning approaches in the regression step. For beginners, we recommend starting with our example Jupyter notebook (@sec-intro-demo) that demonstrates a simple ridge regression approach (suitable for both R and Python users).

![Using MOSAIKS, a simplified workflow design.](../images/mosaiks-overview.png){#fig-mosaiks-flow}

This topic will be covered in greater depth in later chapters. In the next chapter, you will see a simple MOSAIKS workflow which starts from the point of having both features from the API and ground truth labels.
