The main focus is how to choose imagery and considerations for proceessing with a focus on using the data in the MOSAIKS framework. However many of the concepts covered will be broadly applicapble to geospatial information science that utilizes remote sensing technologies. 

## Moving past the MOSAIKS API

Blurb about when to think about getting satellite imagery (i.e. when are API features no longer enough). 

Bit of info on why EO satellites are needed, what they have been used for, and what they could be used for.
