## Overview

In this chapter, we focus on the **publicly available MOSAIKS features** that can be accessed via the [MOSAIKS API](https://api.mosaiks.org/). These features offer a quick and straightforward way to incorporate satellite-based predictors into your analyses without having to manually process satellite imagery.

  [Planet Labs Visual Basemap (Global Quarterly 2019, Q3)](https://developers.planet.com/docs/data/visual-basemaps/).
- **Temporal Coverage**  
  Predominantly images captured between July and September 2019 (Q3), though exact capture dates vary by region.
- **Spatial Coverage**  
  Global land areas, excluding most large water bodies.
- **Potential Artifacts**  
  Cloud cover, haze, or shadows may affect the quality of imagery in regions with significant cloud coverage during Q3 2019.

## Deeper Look: How the API Features Were Generated

The MOSAIKS team performed a **single featurization pass** over the Planet Labs 2019 Q3 Visual Basemap images. The process is similar to the [Random Convolutional Features (RCFs)](#sec-features-rcf) method described earlier, but here are the specific parameters:

1. **Patch Collection**  
   - Random patches (filters) were drawn from real satellite images (Planet Labs 2019 Q3).  
   - Each patch was **whitened**: the raw pixel values were mean-centered and decorrelated so that each filter highlights distinct visual patterns.

2. **Kernel Sizes**  
   - **2,000 features** from a 4×4 patch shape  
   - **2,000 features** from a 6×6 patch shape  
   - All patches maintain **3 color channels** (R, G, B).

3. **Bias & Activation**  
   - A **bias** of –1 is added to each filter’s convolution output, allowing more nuanced activation levels.  
   - A **ReLU** activation (`max(0, x)`) is then applied to keep the model non-linear and remove negative values.

4. **Pooling**  
   - After convolution + ReLU, the response is **average-pooled** over each 0.01° patch (i.e., the local 256×256 pixel area, if we approximate each degree of latitude or longitude as ~100 km—though the exact pixel count can vary by latitude).  
   - This results in a **single numeric value per filter**.

5. **Final Feature Vector**  
   - Combining all filters yields a **4,000-dimensional** vector at each 0.01° grid cell.  
   - This entire process was run **once**, creating a global 0.01° “feature layer.”

## Derived Aggregations

Although the API stores and provides these features at 0.01° resolution, it also offers **pre-aggregated** versions:

- **0.1° and 1° Grids**: Summing or averaging the 0.01° cells.  
- **Administrative Boundaries**: ADM0 (country), ADM1 (state/province), and ADM2 (county/district) levels.  

![Example showing of 3 representative random convolutional features (rows). Features are downloaded from the MOSAIKS API at 0.01° resolution (the native resolution) and aggregated to 3 levels, including (A) larger grid cells (0.1°), (B) counties, and (C) states.](../images/US_feature_summaries.png){#fig-feature-aggregation}

### Area vs. Population Weighting

Each aggregated level comes in two weighting flavors:
- **Area Weighting**: Larger grid cells or polygons with more land area receive more weight in the aggregation.  
- **Population Weighting**: Uses population density ([GPWv4](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/projects/gpw)) to weight cells more heavily where more people live.

**note** maybe a population map here

## When to Use These Features

1. **Readily Available**: If your labels are from ~2019 or a period that hasn’t changed drastically since 2019, start with these API features—they’re the **fastest and easiest** to incorporate into your analyses.

2. **Coarse-Resolution or Aggregated Labels**: If your data is aggregated (e.g., a country-level statistic), consider **downloading the aggregated features** to match your label resolution.

3. **Resource Constraints**: If you’re **storage- or compute-limited**, using the API’s pre-aggregated files can save time and processing overhead.

4. **High-Resolution or Household Data**: For fine-grained tasks (e.g., household surveys), you may still benefit from the 0.01° resolution features—especially if you want to capture local variation. Or you can aggregate to match your label geometry and then **use high-resolution features for prediction** later (see [@sec-model-space]).

## Key Takeaways

1. **Single Source Imagery**  
   - **Planet Labs Visual Basemap (2019 Q3)**  
   - Global coverage of land areas at approximately 0.01° (~1 km) resolution  
   - Three color channels (Red, Green, Blue)

2. **Single Featurization Pass**  
   - All features are computed **once** at the native 0.01° resolution.  
   - Any **aggregated features** (e.g., 0.1°, 1°, administrative boundaries) are **derivative** and use exactly the same underlying 0.01° features.

3. **Random Convolutional Features (RCFs)**  
   - **4,000 total features**  
   - **Kernel sizes**: 2,000 features from a 4×4 kernel, and 2,000 features from a 6×6 kernel  
   - **Empirical patch whitening**: random patches are drawn from the image set and then whitened (mean-centered, decorrelated)  
   - **Bias**: –1 (applied to each filter output before activation)  
   - **Activation**: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)  
   - **3 color channels** from the original RGB imagery

4. **Flexible Resolutions**  
   - **High resolution (0.01°)**: Download via File Query or Map Query  
   - **Aggregations**: 0.1°, 1°, and ADM0/ADM1/ADM2 boundaries, available as precomputed downloads

5. **Use Cases**  
   - Ideal for tasks with label data from the same (or close) time period (2019 or neighboring years)  
   - Quick, straightforward integration into machine learning models  
   - Global scale analysis or smaller local/regional analysis

## Feature data

::: {.callout-note}

Creating satellite image features is covered in later chapters. 
:::

### RCF brief overview 

MOSAIKS relies on random convolutional features (RCFs) computed from satellite imagery. The random nature of the features means that they are task-agnostic. These features can be reused multiple times to model various tasks. Features are generally created over a standard grid of 0.01 by 0.01 degree cells (~1 km², depending on latitude). The output is a feature vector of length *K* for every grid location. 

::: {.callout-note}

Features can be computed at higher or lower resolutions than 1 km². This is discussed in @sec-features-computing. 
:::

### Feature aggregation

The default 1 km² resolution of MOSAIKS is generally the maximum resolution the label data should be in. If the labels are in lower resolution, the satellite features can be aggregated up to larger areas to match. Typical aggregation might be to larger grid cell, census tract, county/district, or state/province levels. The exact aggregation level is contingent on the spatial resolution of the label data. 

![Example showing of 3 representative random convolutional features (rows). Features are downloaded from the MOSAIKS API at 0.01° resolution (the native resolution) and aggregated to 3 levels, including (A) larger grid cells (0.1°), (B) counties, and (C) states.](../images/US_feature_summaries.png){#fig-feature-aggregation}

### API Features 

Currently the MOSAIKS API has a single set of global features ready to download. The features are publicly available for download; this is the fastest and easiest way to begin using MOSAIKS. They come from Planet Labs, Inc. [Visual Basemap](https://developers.planet.com/docs/basemaps/) product Global Quarterly 2019 (quarter 3) which has a native resolution of 4.77 m in the red, green, and blue bands of the visual spectrum. Given this, the easiest way to get started with MOSAIKS is to have label data for a recent time period (ideally from 2019 for fast changing labels, or a close year for more steady labels). To use MOSAIKS for time series data is possible, just not currently with precomputed and publicly available features. To access API features see @sec-api

| Resolution | Time Period | Weighting         | Download      |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 0.01°      | 2019 Q3     | Unweighted        | Query         |
| 0.1°       | 2019 Q3     | Area & population | Chunked files |
| 1°         | 2019 Q3     | Area & population | Single file   |
| ADM2       | 2019 Q3     | Area & population | Single file   |
| ADM1       | 2019 Q3     | Area & population | Single file   |
| ADM0       | 2019 Q3     | Area & population | Single file   |

: The MOSAIKS API offers features at 0.01°, 0.1°, and 1° resolution for the entire globe. Additionally, we provide features aggregated to the ADM0 (country), ADM1 (state/province), and ADM2 (county/municipality) levels. All features share the same 4,000 feature columns, and are all created from the same Planet Labs imagery, the only difference is the resolution/aggregation level. At each level of aggregation, we offer area weighted features and population weighted features. Population weighted features use weights from the [Gridded Population of the World (GPWv4)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4) population density dataset. {#tbl-api-options}
