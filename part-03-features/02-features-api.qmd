## Feature data

::: {.callout-note}

Creating satellite image features is covered in later chapters.

### RCF brief overview 

MOSAIKS relies on random convolutional features (RCFs) computed from satellite imagery. The random nature of the features means that they are task-agnostic. These features can be reused multiple times to model various tasks. Features are generally created over a standard grid of 0.01 by 0.01 degree cells (~1 km², depending on latitude). The output is a feature vector of length *K* for every grid location. 

::: {.callout-note}

Features can be computed at higher or lower resolutions than 1 km². This is discussed in @sec-features-computing.

### Feature aggregation

The default 1 km² resolution of MOSAIKS is generally the maximum resolution the label data should be in. If the labels are in lower resolution, the satellite features can be aggregated up to larger areas to match. Typical aggregation might be to larger grid cell, census tract, county/district, or state/province levels. The exact aggregation level is contingent on the spatial resolution of the label data. 

![Example showing of 3 representative random convolutional features (rows). Features are downloaded from the MOSAIKS API at 0.01° resolution (the native resolution) and aggregated to 3 levels, including (A) larger grid cells (0.1°), (B) counties, and (C) states.](../images/US_feature_summaries.png){#fig-feature-aggregation}

### API Features 

Currently the MOSAIKS API has a single set of global features ready to download. The features are publicly available for download; this is the fastest and easiest way to begin using MOSAIKS. They come from Planet Labs, Inc. [Visual Basemap](https://developers.planet.com/docs/basemaps/) product Global Quarterly 2019 (quarter 3) which has a native resolution of 4.77 m in the red, green, and blue bands of the visual spectrum. Given this, the easiest way to get started with MOSAIKS is to have label data for a recent time period (ideally from 2019 for fast changing labels, or a close year for more steady labels). To use MOSAIKS for time series data is possible, just not currently with precomputed and publicly available features. To access API features see @sec-api

| Resolution | Time Period | Weighting         | Download      |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 0.01°      | 2019 Q3     | Unweighted        | Query         |
| 0.1°       | 2019 Q3     | Area & population | Chunked files |
| 1°         | 2019 Q3     | Area & population | Single file   |
| ADM2       | 2019 Q3     | Area & population | Single file   |
| ADM1       | 2019 Q3     | Area & population | Single file   |
| ADM0       | 2019 Q3     | Area & population | Single file   |

: The MOSAIKS API offers features at 0.01°, 0.1°, and 1° resolution for the entire globe. Additionally, we provide features aggregated to the ADM0 (country), ADM1 (state/province), and ADM2 (county/municipality) levels. All features share the same 4,000 feature columns, and are all created from the same Planet Labs imagery, the only difference is the resolution/aggregation level. At each level of aggregation, we offer area weighted features and population weighted features. Population weighted features use weights from the [Gridded Population of the World (GPWv4)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4) population density dataset. {#tbl-api-options}
