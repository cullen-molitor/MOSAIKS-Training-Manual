## Overview

This demonstration will show you a few key concepts 

## Demonstration code

Below is a link to a Jupyter notebook intended to demonstrate practical featurization of satellite data for use in MOSAIKS. The notebook will guide you through the process of preparing imagery, including:

1. Building a `pytorch` model from scratch

1. Using an out of the box solution with `torchgeo`

1. Building a `torch` `dataset` and `dataloader`

1. Featurizing satellite imagery

1. Saving features to disk

1. Visualizing features

## What's next? 

Now that we have covered the basics of featurizing satellite data, we will move on to the next section, where we will discuss modeling.

# Looking forward

This is the end of the feature section. Next, we will move on to the modeling labels with satellite features.
