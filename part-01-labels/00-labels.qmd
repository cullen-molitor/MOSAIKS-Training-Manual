## Overview

This section explores the ground truth data (labels) used with MOSAIKS. While the system is designed to be flexible in the types of outcomes it can predict, understanding what makes good label data and how to prepare it properly is crucial for success.

Label data represents the "truth" that MOSAIKS attempts to predict - whether that's crop yields, population density, economic indicators, or any other variable that might be visible (directly or indirectly) in satellite imagery. The quality and characteristics of this label data significantly influence model performance.

## What makes good label data?

For optimal performance with MOSAIKS, label data should have several key characteristics:

- Accurate geographic location information
- Appropriate spatial resolution (typically ≥1km²)
- Reasonable temporal alignment with imagery
- Sufficient sample size (generally ≥300 observations)
- Observable connection to surface features

## Section outline

The following chapters will guide you through key considerations for working with label data in MOSAIKS:

@sec-labels-100-maps

- Examples of successful applications
- Understanding performance patterns
- Limits of predictability

@sec-labels-survey

- Working with survey data
- Sampling considerations
- Privacy and ethical concerns
- Integration challenges

@sec-labels-data-prep

- Data cleaning procedures
- Spatial aggregation methods
- Quality control steps
- Joining with features

@sec-labels-demo

- Hands-on examples
- Common pitfalls
- Best practices
- Performance evaluation

These chapters provide both practical guidance for preparing your own label data and deeper understanding of what types of outcomes MOSAIKS can effectively predict.

# Looking forward

In the next chapter, we'll explore over 100 different outcomes that have been tested with MOSAIKS, examining what works well and what doesn't.
