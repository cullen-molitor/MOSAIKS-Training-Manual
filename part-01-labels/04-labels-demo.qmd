## Overview

This demonstration will show you a few key concepts about label data in MOSAIKS. 

## Demonstration code

Below is a link to a Jupyter notebook intented to demonstrate practical preparation of label data for use in MOSAIKS. The notebook will guide you through the process of preparing a dataset for use in MOSAIKS, including:

1. Building and use a MOSAIKS standardised grid 

1. Preparing geographic point labels (latitude and longitude coordinates)

1. Preparing geographic polygon labels (e.g. shapefiles)

1. Preparing raster labels (e.g. GeoTIFFs)

## What's next? 

Now that we have covered the basics of label data, we will move on to the next section, where we will discuss considerations for choosing and processing satellite imagery. This section is not neccessary for users who are either a) okay with using the MOSAIKS API to access features, or b) already have experience working with satellite imagery.

In the next part, we will take a look at considerations for choosing and processing satellite imagery.
