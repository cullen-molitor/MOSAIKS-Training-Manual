Some things are easier to predict than others, but the system is designed to be flexible. For instance, some variables can be seen directly in the imagery itself, such as forest cover. Other outcomes can only be seen through proxy variables like income and housing price which are not directly visible in the imagery but can be estimated by looking at objects in imagery that are correlated with them, such as roads, houses, and cars. \n\n![MOSAIKS versatility makes it the perfect tool for a wide range of applications.](images/army_knife.png){#fig-army-knife width=\"300px\"}\n\nIn this chapter we will explore over 100 different outcomes that have been tested with MOSAIKS. We will discuss the results of a selection of these outcomes in detail, and provide a brief overview of the rest.\n\n## One hundred maps\n\n### Original publication \n\nIn Rolf et al. 2021, the authors tested MOSAIKS on 7 outcomes: forest cover, income, housing price, population density, nighttime luminosity, and elevation. The study area is focused in the continental United States. This is an excellent starting point for understanding the capabilities of MOSAIKS as the data quality is high for a diverse set of outcomes. While the results showed significant promise and demonstrated the potential of MOSAIKS, the true test is in the application to new outcomes and new geographies. \n\n### Going global\n\nTo test the global applicability of MOSAIKS, across a diverse set of outcomes, there were 2 primary things that needed to happen:\n\n**1.** The creation of a global set of features \n\n![Planet Labs visual basemap imagery from quarter 3 of 2019 (left) and 4 of 4,000 MOSAIKS features downloaded from the API (right).](images/api-features.png){#fig-api-features}\n\n**2.** Collecting and currating a large set of outcomes with diversity in spatial structures and categories\n\n\n| **Category**           | **Number of Labels** | **Example Label**             |\n|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Agricultural Assets    | 5                    | Agricultural land ownership   |\n| Agriculture            | 16                   | Maize yield                   |\n| Built Infrastructure   | 9                    | Buildings                     |\n| Demographics           | 5                    | Median age                    |\n| Education              | 10                   | Expected years of schooling   |\n| Health                 | 15                   | Malaria in children           |\n| Household Assets       | 21                   | Mobile phones                 |\n| Income                 | 9                    | Human development index       |\n| Natural Systems        | 8                    | Tree cover                    |\n| Occupation             | 17                   | Unemployment                  |\n\n: The authors selected 115 variables across 10 categories and set to work testing each in the MOSAIKS system. {#tbl-labels} \n\nWith this data in hand, we were able to devise a few simple questions to test:\n\n- Which variables can be effectively measured?\n- What are the most compelling applications?\n- What are the modes of failure?\n\n## Results\n\n### Overall performance\n\nThe results of the 100 maps experiment are shown in the scatter plot below (@fig-100-maps-scatter). Each point in each scatter sub-plot represents a location in the study for a given label. The x-axis is the observed value of the label, and the y-axis is the MOSAIKS-predicted value. The diagonal 45° line in each sub-plot represents perfect prediction. The coefficient of determination (R²) is used here as the primary measure of accuracy.\n\nA few broad insights stand out:\n\n1. **Substantial variation:** Even within the same category, we see varying degrees of predictive power. For instance, in the “Agriculture” category, some labels (such as high-level yield averages) are predicted quite accurately, while others (like certain niche crops or management practices) remain more elusive.\n\n1. **Category differences:** Some categories have consistently higher R² scores. For instance, “Natural Systems” (e.g., tree cover) often score better because the patterns are more directly visible from above—think of large, contiguous forest areas contrasted with open fields or urban centers. On the other hand, “Occupation” or “Demographics” include variables (like unemployment rates) that are largely socio-economic in nature, requiring more indirect and subtle cues.\n\n1. **Failure cases:** A few outcomes show near-random performance, suggesting that the satellite imagery features alone are insufficient to capture their spatial patterns, or that the signals are drowned out by noise (see Failures below).\n\n![The results of the 100 maps experiment with the x-axis shows the observed values of the outcome, while the y-axis shows the predicted values.

Performance is measured with the coefficient of determination (R²).](images/proctor_et_al_100_fig3_scatter.png){#fig-100-maps-scatter}\n\nIn the box plot (@fig-100-maps-box) we see the distribution of R² values for each category across all 115 labels. This confirms the wide range of performance. Categories such as “Agriculture,” “Income,” and “Natural Systems” tend to have higher median R² values; categories such as “Health” and “Occupation” show more varied or lower overall performance.\n\n![The results of the 100 maps experiment.](images/proctor_et_al_100_fig3_box.png){#fig-100-maps-box}\n\nThis heterogeneity underscores an important takeaway: MOSAIKS is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Some phenomena lend themselves to easier detection via satellite data than others. Still, the ability to simultaneously handle over 100 different outcomes from a single feature set is itself a testament to MOSAIKS’ flexibility and global applicability.\n\n### Successes\n\n#### Maize yield\n\nA standout example of a high-performing label is Maize yield (@fig-100-maps-maize-plot). This outcome is naturally suited to detection by satellite imagery:\n\n- **Direct visual signal:** Agricultural fields have characteristic features, including crop texture, canopy cover, and phenological (growth stage) patterns, all of which can be captured in the spectral and spatial signals from satellite images.\n\n<!-- - **Strong seasonal patterns:** Agricultural practices—especially staple crops—are often planted and harvested according to well-defined schedules. This temporal consistency aids in modeling. -->\n\n- **Spatial contiguity:** Large, contiguous fields of maize reduce noise and enable easier extraction of relevant features.\n\nIn the left-hand scatter plot of @fig-100-maps-maize-plot, the predicted yield values match well with the observed values, often clustering along the 45° line. On the right, we see that visually identifiable patterns in maize-growing regions are clearly reflected in the predicted maps. This strong alignment highlights how MOSAIKS can quickly yield robust predictions for outcomes that are clearly manifested in the satellite imagery.\n\n![Perfoprmance of MOSAIKS on Maize yield, showing the observed values plotted against the model predictions (left). Observed label data is shown in the upper right, while the corresponding predictions are shown bottom right.](images/proctor_et_al_100_maize_plot.png){#fig-100-maps-maize-plot}\n\nCrop yields are a classic use case for remote sensing because farmland is often large, geographically dispersed, and subject to rapid changes from weather and management practices—conditions that satellite imagery can routinely monitor at scale. By measuring vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI), researchers gain insight into plant health, canopy density, and photosynthetic activity, all of which correlate strongly with agricultural productivity. This non-invasive, timely, and spatially comprehensive approach makes it invaluable for crop forecasting, detecting stress, and guiding resource allocation. Consequently, remote sensing has become a cornerstone in modern yield estimation methods for staple crops around the world. MOSAIKS is a natural extension of this trend, leveraging the latest in machine learning to extract actionable insights from satellite imagery.\n\n![Agricultural fields in the United States Midwest region. This examples shows the clear delineation of fields with varying color intensities, making for easily detectable features in the satellite imagery.

This composite measure of household wealth is derived from a variety of indicators, such as housing quality, access to services, and ownership of durable goods. While wealth itself is not directly visible from space, the underlying factors that contribute to it often are. For example, wealthier areas tend to have more developed infrastructure, larger homes, and more vehicles—all of which leave distinct signatures in satellite imagery.\n\n![Performance of MOSAIKS on the International Wealth Index (IWI), showing the observed values plotted against the model predictions (left). Observed label data is shown in the upper right, while the corresponding predictions are shown bottom right.](images/proctor_et_al_100_iwi_plot.png){#fig-100-maps-iwi-plot} \n\nDespite being a composite measure of socioeconomic status, the IWI’s underlying indicators—housing conditions, access to utilities, and asset ownership—often manifest in the built environment as features that satellites capture well. For instance, wealthier neighborhoods typically exhibit a higher density of substantial buildings, paved roads, formal layouts, and visible amenities (e.g., swimming pools, parked vehicles). These cues translate into distinctive patterns in the spectral and spatial data extracted by MOSAIKS’ features. Furthermore, infrastructure development and housing materials (like metal roofs versus thatch) can produce detectable differences in reflectance, making it easier for the algorithm to discern socioeconomic gradients. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThis highlights one of MOSAIKS’ core advantages: even when the target variable isn’t directly “visible,” the system can tease out its proxies from wide-ranging visual cues, leading to robust predictions of wealth indices around the globe.\n:::\n\n### Failures\n\nIn contrast, certain labels show extremely low R² values, effectively indicating no predictive power under this approach. One notable example is the presence of underground pipelines @fig-100-maps-pipelines-plot. Unlike forests or agricultural fields, pipeline infrastructure is typically hidden from direct visual inspection—often located entirely underground or obscured in ways that do not provide surface indicators distinguishable in imagery (@fig-100-maps-pipelines-img).\n\n- **Lack of visible features:** There is no spectral or structural cue (e.g., coloration, texture, shape) that reliably indicates the presence of a pipeline.\n\n- **Indirect clues Are unreliable:** One might speculate that pipelines could follow roads or distinct corridors, but these correlations vary widely by region and do not consistently appear in the imagery.\n\n- **Signal-to-noise ratio:** In many areas, the pipeline corridor may appear visually indistinguishable from farmland or other vegetation, leaving little to no unique satellite signature.\n\nAs a result, MOSAIKS has little chance to identify and learn features predictive of such hidden infrastructure. This stands in stark contrast to more visually prominent targets like maize fields or tree cover.\n\n![Where it fails](images/proctor_et_al_100_pipelines_plot.png){#fig-100-maps-pipelines-plot}\n\n![Why it fails - buried](images/proctor_et_al_100_pipelines_img.png){#fig-100-maps-pipelines-img}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n# Looking forward\n\nIn the next chapter, we'll explore survey label data in more detail. \n:::\n",
