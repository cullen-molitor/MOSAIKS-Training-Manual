The choice of imagery should be guided by your specific research needs, label characteristics, and practical constraints like cost and processing requirements.\n\nBased on your label resolution, a user needs to decide on:\n\n- Available time range\n- Sensor resolution\n- Spectral resolution\n- Temporal resolution\n- Sensor type\n- How to handle image quality (i.e. clouds)\n- Processing level (i.e. orthorectification, normalization)\n\n## Time range\n\nThe operational lifespan of satellites is a crucial consideration when choosing imagery sources. Different satellite programs have varying launch dates and operational periods, which affects the historical depth of available data.\n\nFor instance, the Landsat program offers the longest continuous space-based record of Earth's land surface, with missions dating back to 1972. In contrast, more recent satellite programs like Sentinel (launched in 2014) offer higher resolution imagery but have a shorter historical record.\n\nKey considerations for time range include:\n\n- Historical depth needed for your analysis\n- Consistency of sensor technology over time\n- Availability of calibration across different satellite generations\n- Planned mission duration and data continuity\n\n![Source: [NASA](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellites/timeline/)](images/nasa_landsat_timeline.png)\n\n## Sensor resolution (pixel size)\n\nSpatial resolution refers to the size of each pixel in the satellite imagery, which determines the smallest object that can be detected. The choice of spatial resolution should be guided by:\n\n- The physical size of features relevant to your labels\n- The spatial scale of your analysis\n- Storage and processing constraints\n- Cost considerations (higher resolution typically means higher cost)\n\nCommon spatial resolutions:\n- Very high (< 1m): Individual trees, buildings, vehicles\n- High (1-10m): Small agricultural fields, urban infrastructure\n- Medium (10-30m): Large agricultural fields, forest stands\n- Low (> 30m): Regional land cover, climate patterns\n\n![Source: [Radiant Earth](https://medium.com/radiant-earth-insights/observing-the-earth-fueling-global-development-solutions-1c69fd5632bc)](images/radiant_earth_spatial_res.jpeg)\n\n## Spectral resolution (EM range)\n\nSpectral resolution describes the number and width of electromagnetic wavelength bands that a sensor can detect. Different features on Earth's surface reflect or absorb radiation differently across these bands.\n\nKey spectral regions include:\n- Visible light (RGB): 0.4-0.7 μm\n- Near-infrared (NIR): 0.7-1.1 μm\n- Short-wave infrared (SWIR): 1.1-3.0 μm\n- Thermal infrared: 3.0-14 μm\n- Microwave: > 1 mm\n\nApplications by spectral band:\n- RGB: Natural color imagery, built environment\n- NIR: Vegetation health, biomass\n- SWIR: Mineral mapping, moisture content\n- Thermal: Temperature, urban heat islands\n- Microwave: Cloud penetration, soil moisture\n\n![Source: [Radiant Earth](https://medium.com/radiant-earth-insights/observing-the-earth-fueling-global-development-solutions-1c69fd5632bc)](images/radiant_earth_spectral_res.jpeg)\n\n## Temporal resolution (revisit rate)\n\nTemporal resolution refers to how frequently a satellite revisits the same location. This can range from multiple times per day to several weeks between observations.\n\nFactors affecting temporal resolution:\n- Single satellite vs constellation systems\n- Orbital parameters\n- Sensor swath width\n- Cloud cover frequency\n- Latitude of study area\n\nTrade-offs to consider:\n- Higher temporal resolution often means lower spatial resolution\n- Cost increases with temporal frequency\n- Data storage and processing requirements grow with frequency\n\n![Source: [Radiant Earth](https://medium.com/radiant-earth-insights/observing-the-earth-fueling-global-development-solutions-1c69fd5632bc)](images/radiant_earth_temporal_res.jpeg)\n\n## Cloud cover\n\nCloud cover presents a significant challenge in optical satellite imagery. Several strategies exist for handling cloud contamination:\n\n- Cloud masking algorithms\n- Composite images over time periods\n- Use of radar satellites (which penetrate clouds)\n- Strategic timing of image acquisition\n- Gap-filling techniques\n\nImpact on analysis:\n- Reduced data availability\n- Temporal inconsistency\n- Need for quality control\n- Processing overhead\n\n## Sensor type\n\nSatellite sensors broadly fall into two categories:\n\n### Passive sensors\n- Detect natural radiation (reflected sunlight or emitted heat)\n- Include optical and thermal sensors\n- Limited by atmospheric conditions\n- Typically easier to interpret\n\n### Active sensors\n- Emit their own energy and measure the return signal\n- Include radar (SAR) and lidar\n- Can penetrate clouds and operate at night\n- Often require more complex processing\n\n![Source: [Radiant Earth](https://medium.com/radiant-earth-insights/observing-the-earth-fueling-global-development-solutions-1c69fd5632bc)](images/radiant_earth_active_passive.jpeg)\n\n## Public satellites {#sec-satellite-public}\n\n### Optical sensors\n- **Sentinel-2**: 10-60m resolution, 5-day revisit, 13 spectral bands\n- **Landsat 8/9**: 15-100m resolution, 16-day revisit, 11 spectral bands\n- **MODIS**: 250m-1km resolution, daily revisit, 36 spectral bands\n\n### Radar sensors\n- **Sentinel-1**: C-band SAR, 5-40m resolution, 6-12 day revisit\n- **NISAR**: L-band and S-band SAR (launching 2024)\n\n### Other\n- **VIIRS**: 375m-750m resolution, daily global coverage\n- **ASTER**: 15-90m resolution, 16-day revisit, 14 spectral bands\n\n## Private satellites {#sec-satellite-private}\n\n### Very high resolution\n- **Maxar WorldView**: 31cm panchromatic, 1.24m multispectral\n- **Planet SkySat**: 50cm panchromatic, 1m multispectral\n- **Airbus Pleiades**: 50cm panchromatic, 2m multispectral\n\n### High resolution\n- **Planet PlanetScope**: 3-5m resolution, daily revisit\n- **Planet RapidEye**: 5m resolution, 5.5-day revisit\n- **SPOT**: 1.5-6m resolution, 26-day revisit\n\n### Specialized\n- **ICEYE**: X-band SAR, <1m resolution\n- **Capella Space**: X-band SAR, 50cm resolution\n- **GHGSat**: Greenhouse gas monitoring\n\n## Processing levels\n\nSatellite imagery is typically available at different processing levels.
