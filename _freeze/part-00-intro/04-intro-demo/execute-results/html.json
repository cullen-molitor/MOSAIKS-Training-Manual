While MOSAIKS great potential to improve access to satellite-based prediction in data-sparse environments, the original paper focused on demonstrating performance in the United States where high-quality training data was readily available.\n\nThe US served as an ideal testing ground for several reasons:\n\n- Extensive ground truth data available across multiple variables\n- Reliable spatial referencing of data\n- Diverse landscapes and built environments\n- Ability to benchmark against existing methods\n- Systematic validation of predictions\n\nThis validation in a data-rich environment was crucial for establishing MOSAIKS as a reliable tool before deploying it in contexts where ground truth data is scarce or unreliable. \n\n## Demonstration code\n\nBelow is a link to a Jupyter notebook intented to demonstrate practical use of MOSAIKS with real data. In fact, this notebook uses the original input data and features from Rolf et al. 2021. The code demonstrates:\n\n1. Loading pre-computed MOSAIKS features and labels\n2. Merging the features and labels\n3. Training a ridge regression model\n4. Evaluating predictions\n5. Visualizing results\nThe demo showcases MOSAIKS predicting several variables:\n\n> Forest cover, elevation, population density, nighttime lights, income, & road length\n\nA user simply needs to select which variable they would like to predict, and no other changes need to be made to the code. \n\nTo stay within the Colab free tier limits of memory usage, we subset the data. We take a 50% random sample of both features (*K*=4,000 instead of 8,192) and observations (*N*=50,000 instead of 100,000) compared to the original paper. Despite using this reduced dataset, the demo still achieves strong predictive performance, highlighting MOSAIKS's efficiency.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n# Click the badge to run the demonstration! \n\n&darr;&darr;&darr;&darr;&darr;&darr;&darr;&darr;&darr;&darr;&darr;&darr;&darr;&darr;&darr;&darr;   \n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cullen-molitor/MOSAIKS-Training-Manual/blob/main/notebooks/demo/01-Rolf_et_al_2021_demo.ipynb)  \n<!-- &uarr;&uarr;&uarr;&uarr;&uarr;&uarr;&uarr;&uarr;&uarr;&uarr;&uarr;&uarr;&uarr;&uarr;&uarr;&uarr;     -->\nRemember to click `File` -> `Save a copy in Drive` to save any changes you make.  \n\n\n\n---\nOr to view a static version of the code on GitHub, click the badge below.  \n[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/View%20on%20GitHub-181717?logo=github&logoColor=white&labelColor=grey&color=black&link=--)](https://github.com/cullen-molitor/MOSAIKS-Training-Manual/blob/main/notebooks/demo/01-Rolf_et_al_2021_demo.ipynb)\n:::\n\nFor instructions and tips on using Google Colab, please refer to @sec-intro-compute. \n\n## Don't want to run code?\n\nConsider watching this demonstration instead!\n\n::: {#fig-demo}\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/ux2c-ot3Ce0?si=Oalkj-4MsJN5hNCh >}}\n\nAn overview of MOSAIKS and a live demonstration of generating novel predictions using the system. Video recoreded by CIGAR Generalized Planetary Remote Sensing - 2020 Convention session. Presented by Esther Rolf and Tamma Carleton.\n:::\n\n## What's next? \n\nAfter establishing MOSAIKS's capabilities in the US context, the MOSAIKS development team have successfully demonstrated the system in many additional settings. This includes on the global scale, or in settings with few or low quality data. In the coming chapters, we will explore some of these applications, showing how MOSAIKS can help address data gaps in regions where traditional data collection is challenging or costly.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n# Looking forward\n\nIn the next section we will take a closer look at the label data that can be used with MOSAIKS. \n:::\n",
