Each day is structured as follows:\n\n| **Time**       | **Activity**       |\n|----------------|--------------------|\n| 9:00 - 10:30   | Morning Session 1  |\n| 10:30 - 11:00  | Break              |\n| 11:00 - 12:30  | Morning Session 2  |\n| 12:30 - 1:30   | Lunch              |\n| 1:30 - 3:00    | Afternoon Session 1|\n| 3:00 - 3:30    | Break              |\n| 3:30 - 4:30    | Afternoon Session 2|\n| 4:30 - 5:00    | Feedback and Development |\n\n: {.striped .hover}\n\nEach day concludes with a Q&A and feedback session from 4:30-5:00, providing opportunities to clarify concepts and share ideas. It is expected that this first course will spur many new ideas and concepts which should be included in the future trainings. Please remember to take notes throughout each day with particular emphasis in areas you think could be explained better or that need additional topics covered. These can be areas that you struggled with or that you would anticipate could be difficult for others.\n\n## Schedule overview\n\n| Day | Week 1 | Week 2 |\n|-----|---------|---------|\n| Monday | Orientation and introduction to MOSAIKS | *Holiday - No Class* |\n| Tuesday | Ground labels and data processing fundamentals | Task modeling and machine learning applications |\n| Wednesday | Agriculture applications and MOSAIKS API | Understanding uncertainty in MOSAIKS |\n| Thursday | Satellite imagery fundamentals and processing | Survey data processing and design |\n| Friday | Deep dive into random convolutional features (RCFs) | Future directions and advanced applications |\n\n: Course schedule by week {.striped .hover}\n\nMain topics covered each day:\n\n### Week 1\n- **Day 1**: MOSAIKS framework, accessing features, basic workflow\n- **Day 2**: Understanding ground truth data, data cleaning, spatial resolution\n- **Day 3**: Agricultural yield prediction, downloading features via API\n- **Day 4**: Types of satellite imagery, processing considerations, quality control\n- **Day 5**: Feature computation, theory behind RCFs, hands-on implementation\n\n### Week 2  \n- **Day 1**: *Martin Luther King Jr. Day - No Class*\n- **Day 2**: Model selection, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation\n- **Day 3**: Error analysis, confidence intervals, reporting uncertainty\n- **Day 4**: Survey design principles, geolocation methods, sampling strategies\n- **Day 5**: Advanced topics, emerging applications, future development\n\n## Training expectations\n\n### What you will learn\n- Understanding of MOSAIKS framework and capabilities\n- Practical skills in satellite imagery processing  \n- Experience with machine learning applications\n- Hands-on practice with real-world datasets\n- Knowledge of survey data integration\n- Best practices for model implementation\n\n### Prerequisites\nThere are no explicit prerequisites, though this course does cover some advanced topics in:\n\n- The [`Python`](https://www.python.org/){target=\"_blank\"} programming language\n- Machine learning\n- Geospatial data\n\n### Participant expectations\n- Active participation in discussions and hands-on sessions\n- Completion of assigned homework (particularly the Week 1 Friday assignment)  \n- Engagement in Q&A sessions\n- Contribution to feedback sessions for course improvement\n\n### Computing requirements  \nThe course includes hands-on computing sessions. You will need:\n\n- A computer with access to the internet\n- A Google account \n- Access to Google Colaboratory\n- Access to necessary data (details to be provided)\n\n### Homework and presentations\nThere will be a homework assignment at the end of Week 1, which participants will present on Tuesday of Week 2. This assignment is designed to reinforce learning and provide practical experience with MOSAIKS tools.\n",
