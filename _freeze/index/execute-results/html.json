The manual serves as a comprehensive reference for understanding MOSAIKS, its capabilities, and practical implementation guidance.\n\n![Made with: [Your Name in Landsat](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/apps/YourNameInLandsat-main/)](images/mosaiks-in-landsat.png)\n\nMOSAIKS stands for **<ins>M</ins>ulti-task <ins>O</ins>bservation using <ins>SA</ins>tellite <ins>I</ins>magery & <ins>K</ins>itchen <ins>S</ins>inks**. It is a framework designed to simplify the use of satellite imagery and machine learning for analyzing socioeconomic and environmental outcomes across different geographic contexts and time periods.\n\nThis comprehensive two-week program is designed for academics, professionals, and policymakers interested in leveraging MOSAIKS to better understand socioeconomic and environmental challenges. The course is particularly valuable for those working in:\n\n- Remote sensing and satellite imagery analysis\n- Machine learning applications with geospatial data \n- Agricultural monitoring and assessment\n- Development research and policy making\n\nThroughout this course, you'll learn practical applications through a combination of:\n\n- Theoretical foundations and conceptual understanding\n- Hands-on exercises with real-world data\n- Best practices for implementation\n- Strategies for analyzing and interpreting results\n\nThe curriculum covers the complete MOSAIKS workflow:\n\n- Accessing and processing satellite imagery\n- Understanding MOSAIKS feature extraction\n- Working with the MOSAIKS API\n- Implementing machine learning models\n- Quantifying and communicating uncertainty\n- Applying models to various contexts\n- Working with survey data\n\nWhether you're new to MOSAIKS or looking to deepen your expertise, this course provides the tools and knowledge needed to effectively utilize this powerful framework.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nMOSAIKS was developed and is supported by researchers across multiple partner organizations:\n\n**Core Team:**\n\nBenjamin Recht, Esther Rolf, Tamma Carleton, Eugenio Noda, Hikari Murayama, Hannah Druckenmiller, Ian Bolliger, Jeanette Tseng, Jessica Katz, Jonathan Proctor, Luke Sherman, Miyabi Ishihara, Simon Greenhill, Solomon Hsiang, Taryn Fransen, Trinetta Chong, Vaishaal Shankar, Graeme Blair, Darin Christensen, Shopnavo Biswas, Karena Yan, Cullen Molitor, Grace Lewin, Steven Cognac, Juliet Cohen\n\n**Partner Organizations:**\n\n- Center for Effective Global Action ([CEGA](https://cega.berkeley.edu/); UCB)\n- Environmental Markets Lab ([emLab](https://emlab.ucsb.edu/); UCSB) \n- Global Policy Lab ([GPL](https://www.globalpolicy.science/); Stanford University)\n- Harvard Data Science Initiative ([HDSI](https://datascience.harvard.edu/); Harvard University)\n- Project on Resources and Governance ([PRG](https://projectrg.org/); UCLA)\n- Master of Environmental Data Science Program ([MEDS](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science); UCSB)\n\n**Funding Support:**\n\n- [The Patrick J.
