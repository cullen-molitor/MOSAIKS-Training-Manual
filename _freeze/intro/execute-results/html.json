Each day is structured as follows:\n\n| **Time**       | **Activity**       |\n|----------------|--------------------|\n| 9:00 - 10:30   | Morning Session 1  |\n| 10:30 - 11:00  | Break              |\n| 11:00 - 12:30  | Morning Session 2  |\n| 12:30 - 1:30   | Lunch              |\n| 1:30 - 3:00    | Afternoon Session 1|\n| 3:00 - 3:30    | Break              |\n| 3:30 - 4:30    | Afternoon Session 2|\n| 4:30 - 5:00    | Feedback and Development |\n\n: {.striped .hover}\n\nEach day concludes with a Q&A and feedback session from 4:30-5:00, providing opportunities to clarify concepts and share ideas. It is expected that this first course will spur many new ideas and concepts which should be included in the future trainings. Please remember to take notes throughout each day with particular emphasis in areas you think could be explained better or that need additional topics covered. These can be areas that you struggled with or that you would anticipate could be difficult for others.\n\n## Schedule overview\n\n### Week 1\n- **Monday**: Orientation and introduction to MOSAIKS\n- **Tuesday**: Ground labels and data processing fundamentals\n- **Wednesday**: Agriculture applications and MOSAIKS API\n- **Thursday**: Satellite imagery fundamentals and processing\n- **Friday**: Deep dive into Random Convolutional Features (RCFs)\n\n### Week 2\n- **Monday**: Martin Luther King Jr. Day (holiday - no class)\n- **Tuesday**: Task modeling and machine learning applications\n- **Wednesday**: Understanding uncertainty in MOSAIKS\n- **Thursday**: Survey data processing and design\n- **Friday**: Future directions and advanced applications\n\n## Training expectations\n\n### What you will learn \n- Understanding of MOSAIKS framework and capabilities\n- Practical skills in satellite imagery processing\n- Experience with machine learning applications\n- Hands-on practice with real-world datasets\n- Knowledge of survey data integration\n- Best practices for model implementation\n\n### Prerequisites\nThere are no explcicit prerequisites, though this course does cover some advanced topics in: \n\n- The [`Python`](https://www.python.org/){target=\"_blank\"} programming language  \n- Machine Learning   \n- Geospatial data  \n\n### Participant expectations\n- Active participation in discussions and hands-on sessions\n- Completion of assigned homework (particularly the Week 1 Friday assignment)\n- Engagement in Q&A sessions\n- Contribution to feedback sessions for course improvement\n\n### Computing requirements\nThe course includes hands-on computing sessions.
