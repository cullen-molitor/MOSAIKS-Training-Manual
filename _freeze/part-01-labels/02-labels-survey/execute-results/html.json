Unlike many other data sources that may be consistently gathered through automated systems or administrative records, survey data:\n\n- Captures detailed household and individual-level information that's otherwise unobservable\n- Often follows complex sampling designs that need special handling\n- May have inconsistent geographic referencing across different surveys\n- Requires careful consideration of privacy and ethical concerns\n- Can be expensive and time-consuming to collect, making validation of MOSAIKS predictions particularly valuable\n\n## Types of survey data\n\nSeveral major categories of surveys are commonly used with MOSAIKS:\n\n### Household surveys\n- Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS)\n- Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)\n- Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)\n- Labor force surveys\n- National census data\n\n### Agricultural surveys\n- Agricultural censuses\n- Crop cutting surveys\n- Farm management surveys\n- Agricultural household surveys\n\n### Economic surveys\n- Enterprise surveys\n- Market price surveys\n- Consumer expenditure surveys\n\n## Accessing survey data\n\nSurvey data access varies by source and type:\n\n### Public repositories\n- World Bank Microdata Library\n- IPUMS International\n- DHS Program website\n- FAO statistical databases\n\n### National statistical offices\n- Census bureaus\n- Agricultural ministries\n- Economic agencies\n\n### Research institutions\n- Universities\n- Think tanks\n- Research organizations\n\n## Working with survey data\n\n### LSMS data\nThe Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) requires specific considerations:\n\n- Complex multi-topic household surveys\n- Detailed geographic information\n- Panel structure in some countries\n- Integration with agricultural data\n- Varying spatial referencing methods\n\nExample of loading and processing LSMS data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ndef load_lsms_data(data_path, year):\n    \"\"\"\n    Load and process LSMS survey data\n    \n    Parameters:\n    -----------\n    data_path : str\n        Path to LSMS data files\n    year : int\n        Survey year to process\n        \n    Returns:\n    --------\n    DataFrame with processed LSMS data\n    \"\"\"\n    # Load household data\n    hh_data = pd.read_csv(Path(data_path) / f\"household_{year}.csv\")\n    \n    # Load geographic data\n    geo_data = pd.read_csv(Path(data_path) / f\"geographic_{year}.csv\")\n    \n    # Merge datasets\n    merged_data = pd.merge(\n        hh_data, \n        geo_data,\n        on='household_id',\n        how='inner'\n    )\n    \n    return merged_data\n```\n\n### DHS data\nThe Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) present unique characteristics:\n\n- Standardized across countries\n- Cluster-based sampling\n- Displaced GPS coordinates\n- Rich health and demographic indicators\n- Regular update cycle\n\nExample of handling DHS displacement:\n\n```python\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef adjust_dhs_coordinates(gdf, displacement=2000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adjust for DHS coordinate displacement\n    \n    Parameters:\n    -----------\n    gdf : GeoDataFrame\n        DHS data with point geometry\n    displacement : float\n        Buffer distance in meters\n        \n    Returns:\n    --------\n    GeoDataFrame with uncertainty buffers\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create uncertainty buffers\n    gdf['geometry'] = gdf.geometry.buffer(displacement)\n    \n    return gdf\n```\n\n## Remote sensing informed survey design\n\nMOSAIKS can enhance survey design in several ways:\n\n### Pre-survey planning\n- Optimize sampling frame using satellite-derived information\n- Identify areas of interest based on physical characteristics\n- Stratify sampling based on predicted characteristics\n\n### During survey implementation\n- Validate location information\n- Guide field teams with up-to-date imagery\n- Monitor survey progress\n\n### Post-survey analysis\n- Validate survey responses against satellite indicators\n- Fill data gaps in hard-to-reach areas\n- Create high-resolution predictions from survey samples\n\nExample of using MOSAIKS features for survey planning:\n\n```python\ndef optimize_sampling_locations(features_df, n_samples, strata_col='predicted_class'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Optimize survey sampling locations using MOSAIKS features\n    \n    Parameters:\n    -----------\n    features_df : DataFrame\n        MOSAIKS features with coordinates\n    n_samples : int\n        Number of sampling locations needed\n    strata_col : str\n        Column name for stratification\n        \n    Returns:\n    --------\n    DataFrame with selected sampling locations\n    \"\"\"\n    # Stratified random sampling\n    samples = features_df.groupby(strata_col).apply(\n        lambda x: x.sample(n=n_samples // len(features_df[strata_col].unique()))\n    )\n    \n    return samples\n```\n\nThis integration of MOSAIKS with survey data represents a powerful approach for both enhancing traditional survey methods and extending their reach through satellite-based prediction.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n# Looking forward\n\nIn the next chapter, we'll look at practical guidance for preparing label data for use with MOSAIKS, including data cleaning, agregation, and joining to satellite features.\n:::\n",
