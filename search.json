    "title": "2  What is MOSAIKS?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "2.1 How MOSAIKS works\nRight now, numerous public satellite systems collect huge amounts of data about the world every day. But there is so much imagery (terabytes per day) that it’s overwhelming to sort through by hand; and it’s too complex and unstructured to be usable in its raw form for most applications.\nThat is why linking satellite imaging to machine learning (SIML) is incredibly powerful. It enables vast amounts of unstructured image data to be transformed into structured information that can immediately be used for planning, research, and decision-making.\nWe believe that people all over the world should be able to access SIML technologies, but we also recognize that most people who would benefit the most from these tools don’t have the time or resources to manage enormous satellite imagery data sets and learn how to apply machine learning to them.\nThat’s why we developed MOSAIKS.\nMOSAIKS is designed to work “out of the box” for a wide array of SIML applications, for people with no SIML expertise who work on normal desktop computers. MOSAIKS users never actually have to touch satellite imagery themselves and only need to have basic statistical training.\nMOSAIKS empowers users to create their own new data sets from satellite imagery. We don’t control what variables users look at, and we never need to know. MOSAIKS is a system that allows users to quickly transform vast amounts of imagery into maps of new variables, using their own training data.\nIf you’ve ever been curious about trying machine learning with satellite imagery, but don’t know anything about machine learning or satellite imagery, MOSAIKS is for you.\nAnd if you know a lot about machine learning and satellite imagery, MOSAIKS might still be for you, since it performs competitively with deep learning methods but is much simpler and cheaper to use.\nThe basic idea of MOSAIKS is to seperate users from the costly and difficult process of transforming imagery into inputs (called “features”) for a machine learning algorithm (images → X). We do that part, so users never have to download or manage imagery. Users then download a table of MOSAIKS features (X), link them to their own geocoded data on the outcome (Y) they are interested in (called “labels”) and run a linear regression to predict their labels using MOSAIKS features (Y = Xβ).\nAll users use the same MOSAIKS features and just match them to their labels based on location. Users can run their analysis on any statistical software they are comfortable with. For most applications, the computing demands will not require users to work with specialized machines, since desktops and laptops work.\nMOSAIKS works because MOSAIKS features captures a huge amount of information about the colors, patterns and textures that show up in satellite imagery. We don’t know what patterns/colors/textures will be important for the application that users have (since we don’t know what applications users will try), so we just try to capture all of them. The purpose of the regression step is to teach the model which patterns/colors/textures predict the labels, and then to use that understanding to make predictions in locations where users don’t have labels. In addition, MOSAIKS encodes image information in a way that allows for nonlinear relationships between labels and images, even though the regression that users implement is a linear regression.\nFor users, the procedure for using MOSAIKS has five steps (corresponding figure from Rolf et al. is below):\nWe’ve found that MOSAIKS works well across diverse prediction tasks (e.g. forest cover, house price, population, road length, elevation, income) and it achieves accuracy competitive with deep neural networks at orders of magnitude lower computational cost.\nIf you are interested in using MOSAIKS, you can also see our tutorial and slide deck. And if you have a little bit of time, we recommend reading the paper we wrote when we introduced the system. We wrote it with users in mind, so we tried to make it as clear and accessible as possible.\nIf you use MOSAIKS, please reference: Rolf et al. “A generalizable and accessible approach to machine learning with global satellite imagery.” Nature Communications (2021).",

These features are based on Planet imagery. These files are relatively small in size and can be used at these resolutions or to downscale administrative data. To download them, register at api.mosaiks.org and access them via the “Precomputed Files” tab.\nUSA grid from Rolf et al (Google basemap imagery) You can download features for a set of locations across the United States, as described in Rolf et al. (Nature Communications, 2021). These features are based on imagery from the Google Earth base map. You can download the features from the Code Ocean Capsule associated with that manuscript (the capsule will also allow you to replicate the analysis of that paper on a remote machine). The Github repository for that analysis is here.\nGlobal 0.01 x 0.01 degree grid (Planet imagery) You can download features for a complete and dense grid of global land areas via our API. These features are based on on quarterly mosaics from Planet’s Surface Reflectance Basemaps produce from 2019 Q3. Because the complete data set is large (multiple TB), you will need to request custom subsamples of the imagery. To download them, register at api.mosaiks.org and access them via the “Map Query” tool or by uploading a list of locations via the “File Query” tool.\nRecompute MOSAIKS features (Landsat & Sentinel imagery) You can recompute MOSAIKS features yourself using Microsoft’s Planetary Computer (Github repo which currently supports Gaussian random convolutional features). This approach will not provide the benefit of pre-computed features, since you will recompute features on-the-fly every time, but the massive compute power of the Planetary Computer makes this relatively fast and cheap for users.",

    "text": "Resolution\nThe preparation of label data for MOSAIKS hinges on multiple factors, particularly spatial information such as location, extent, and resolution. If the observations in a dataset have a higher resolution than 1 km², some form of selection or aggregation is required. Label data can come in any native spatial form: raster, point, polygon, or vector. As long as there is spatial information associated with each label data observation, these data can be joined to MOSAIKS imagery features for downstream prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MOSAIKS API is designed to predict outcomes at scales of 1 km² or larger. Customizable solutions are possible for higher resolution problems..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Examples of label data formats that can be easily integrated into the MOSAIKS pipeline. Label data of any spatial format that can be aggregated to at least the scale of 1km² (or larger) can be used directly in combination with MOSAIKS imagery features for downstream prediction tasks. Examples shown here are from Rolf et al. (2021) and include: forest cover, elevation, population, and nighttime lights datasets (all raster format); income data (polygon format); road length (vector format); and housing price data (point format).\n\n\n\n\n\nSample size\nAs with many machine learning algorithms, a large sample size often results in higher performance than low. MOSAIKS has been used and shown to be effective with a wide range of sample sizes (N). The sample size for model training is determined by the spatial and temporal resolution of your label data. For example, when predicting maize yields in the US using ground data from one year of farmer-level surveys in the US, N=3,143 if farmers are geolocated based on their county (even if far more than 3,143 farmers were interviewed, as this is the number of counties in the US). Additional time periods increase sample size for training, but also require more up-front costs, as more imagery need to be “featurized”.\n\n\nExample variables\nThe original MOSAIKS publication (Rolf et al., 2021) tested performance for forest cover, income, housing price, population density, nighttime luminosity, and elevation using sample sizes ranging from 60,000 to 100,000, but showed that performance fell only modestly when N shrank to just a few hundred observations. Consistent with this finding, in recent experiments with crop yield, we see high with only around 400 observations (R² = 0.80). It is important to note that the original crop yield dataset included interview data from thousands of farmers across the study country, and this messy data was cleaned and aggregated to the district level prior to modeling. In this case, a clean dataset with a low number of observations was preferred to a large but noisy dataset. Despite the low sample size of the aggregate data, performance was still comparable to more complex CNN models trained specifically on crop yield.\n\n\nData types\nMOSAIKS accommodates both continuous (e.g., fraction of area forested) and discrete (e.g., presence/absence of water) labels, with data type influencing model development and testing. Performance metric selection is also determined by data type - for continuous variables, we typically use the coefficient of determination (R²), while for discrete variables, the area under the curve value from the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC AUC score) is used.\n\n\nSummary\nIn sum, for ease of use with MOSAIKS, label data should:\n\nBe consistently geolocated as point, polygon, vector, or raster data\n\nBe in a format that can be aggregated to at least 1km², or lower resolution\n\nReflect an outcome that can feasibly be observed in daytime satellite imagery, or is the result or driver of an outcome that can feasibly be observed in daytime satellite imagery\n\nBe recent or slow changing, if use with current MOSAIKS imagery features is desired\n\nBe of at least a sample size N≈300, with expectations of higher performance at higher sample sizes",

    "text": "Feature data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating satellite image features is covered in later chapters.\n\n\n\n\nRCF brief overview\nMOSAIKS relies on random convolutional features (RCFs) computed from satellite imagery. The random nature of the features means that they are task-agnostic. These features can be reused multiple times to model various tasks. Features are generally created over a standard grid of 0.01 by 0.01 degree cells (~1 km², depending on latitude). The output is a feature vector of length K for every grid location. Depending on the spatial scale and resolution of the label data, subsampling the MOSAIKS grid may be appropriate to reduce computation time and cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures can be computed at higher or lower resolutions than 1 km². This is discussed in 14  Computing Features.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature aggrgegation\nThe default 1 km² resolution of MOSAIKS is generally the maximum resolution the label data should be in. If the labels are in lower resolution, the satellite features can be aggregated up to larger areas to match. Typical aggregation might be to larger grid cell, census tract, county/district, or state/province levels. The exact aggregation level is contingent on the spatial resolution of the label data.\nAdd feature maps figs\n\n\nAPI Features\nCurrently the MOSAIKS API has a single global set of features that are precalculated and ready to download. This static layer is computed from Planet Labs, Inc. Basemaps product Global Quarterly 2019 (qaurter 3) which has a native resolution of 4.77 m in the red, green, and blue bands of the visual spectrum (see 11  Private Satellites for more details). The features are publicly available for download; this is the fastest and easiest way to begin using MOSAIKS.\nGiven this, the easiest way to get started with MOSAIKS is to have label data for a recent time period (ideally from 2019 for fast changing labels, or a close year for more steady labels). To use MOSAIKS for time series data is possible, just not currently with precomputed and publicly available features. To access API features see 3  Access MOSAIKS\nadd details of api products available (0.1 degree and pop/area weighted etc)",

To join this data, we first found all of the feature locations that fall within the district boundaries using a spatial join. Then we averaged the features within each district. This allowed us to have a single feature vector for each district. The resulting tabular data is then ready for modeling.\nNote: Add example code for joining data",

For instance, during a region’s rainy season it may be much more difficult to obtain high quality cloud free images. This has the potential to leave large gaps in the feature data and may require imputation to fill these gaps.\nTake crop yield for example. The data is typically annual, but the seasonal conditions can have a massive impact on yield. To capture seasonal variation, monthly or quarterly satellite features can be used with yearly labels. This would mean that each observation has K features for each time step t (K*t features). Let’s say we have 1,000 features computed monthly, then our crop yield would be predicted by 12,000 features. An important point of this data is that there are consistent locations with regular yield measurements.",

This should be guided by intuition of what scale is necessary for the satellite to detect your labels, as well as availability of imagery. For example, tree cover may not require the same resolution of imagery to detect effectively as crop yield.\n\n\n\nSource: Radiant Earth\n\n\n\n\nSpectral resolution (EM range)\nThe avaialable electromagnetic radiation spectrum of the sensor\n\n\n\nSource: Radiant Earth\n\n\n\n\nTemporal resolution (revisit rate)\nSingle satellite revisit vs constellations\n\n\n\nSource: Radiant Earth\n\n\n\n\nCloud cover\nData quality can also be affected by cloud cover. This may affect your choice of satellite.

Publicly available satellite imagery such as Landsat and Sentinel offer a rich time series, but their use with MOSAIKS will require custom feature generation. The label data’s timestep will play an important role in determining the satellite imagery required for computing features.\nThe simplest implementation uses composite satellite images that are highly processed to remove clouds and low quality pixels, and is often normalized and color balanced.
