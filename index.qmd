## What is MOSAIKS?

MOSAIKS stands for **<ins>M</ins>ulti-task <ins>O</ins>bservation using <ins>SA</ins>tellite <ins>I</ins>magery & <ins>K</ins>itchen <ins>S</ins>inks**. It is a framework designed to simplify the use of satellite imagery and machine learning for analyzing socioeconomic and environmental outcomes across different geographic contexts and time periods.

## Who is this for?

This comprehensive two-week program is designed for academics, professionals, and policymakers interested in leveraging MOSAIKS to better understand socioeconomic and environmental challenges. The course is particularly valuable for those working in:

- Remote sensing and satellite imagery analysis
- Machine learning applications with geospatial data 
- Agricultural monitoring and assessment
- Development research and policy making

## What will I learn?

Throughout this course, you'll learn practical applications through a combination of:

- Theoretical foundations and conceptual understanding
- Hands-on exercises with real-world data
- Best practices for implementation
- Strategies for analyzing and interpreting results

The curriculum covers the complete MOSAIKS workflow:

- Accessing and processing satellite imagery
- Understanding MOSAIKS feature extraction
- Working with the MOSAIKS API
- Implementing machine learning models
- Quantifying and communicating uncertainty
- Applying models to various contexts
- Working with survey data

Whether you're new to MOSAIKS or looking to deepen your expertise, this course provides the tools and knowledge needed to effectively utilize this powerful framework.

## Course structure 

This course is designed as an intensive two-week program that combines lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on sessions. Each day is structured as follows:

| **Time**       | **Activity**       |
|----------------|:-------------------|
| 9:00 - 10:30   | Morning Session 1  |
| 10:30 - 11:00  | Break              |
| 11:00 - 12:30  | Morning Session 2  |
| 12:30 - 1:30   | Lunch              |
| 1:30 - 3:00    | Afternoon Session 1|
| 3:00 - 3:30    | Break              |
| 3:30 - 4:30    | Afternoon Session 2|
| 4:30 - 5:00    | Feedback and Development |

: Daily time divisions showing 2 morning sessions, 2 afternoon sessions, and a final time slot alloted for developing the course further. {#tbl-course-outline .striped .hover}

Each day concludes with a Q&A and feedback session from 4:30-5:00, providing opportunities to clarify concepts and share ideas. It is expected that this first course will spur many new ideas and concepts which should be included in the future trainings. Please remember to take notes throughout each day with particular emphasis in areas you think could be explained better or that need additional topics covered. These can be areas that you struggled with or that you would anticipate could be difficult for others.

## Book structure and content

This manual is organized into six main parts, each focusing on a critical aspect of MOSAIKS. We begin with foundational concepts and gradually progress to more advanced topics in modeling and uncertainty quantification.

| Part | Description |
|------|:------------|
| Introduction | Computing setup, MOSAIKS overview, API access, initial demonstration |
| Label data | Understanding suitable labels, survey integration, data preparation |
| Satellite imagery | Selecting appropriate imagery, processing considerations |
| Features | Random convolutional features, API access, feature computation |
| Task modeling | Model selection, spatial analysis, temporal considerations |
| Model uncertainty | Uncertainty quantification, ethical considerations |

: Overview of the MOSAIKS Training Manual contents {#tbl-part-outline .striped .hover}

The content is designed to be both comprehensive and practical, with each part building upon previous concepts while remaining relatively self-contained. This structure allows readers to either progress through the manual sequentially or focus on specific topics of interest. Throughout each section, we provide practical examples, code demonstrations, and best practices drawn from real-world applications.
