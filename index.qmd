MOSAIKS stands for **<ins>M</ins>ulti-task <ins>O</ins>bservation using <ins>SA</ins>tellite <ins>I</ins>magery & <ins>K</ins>itchen <ins>S</ins>inks**. It is a framework designed to simplify the use of satellite imagery and machine learning for analyzing socioeconomic and environmental outcomes across different geographic contexts and time periods.

This comprehensive two-week program is designed for academics, professionals, and policymakers interested in leveraging MOSAIKS to better understand socioeconomic and environmental challenges. The course is particularly valuable for those working in:

- Remote sensing and satellite imagery analysis
- Machine learning applications with geospatial data 
- Agricultural monitoring and assessment
- Development research and policy making

Throughout this course, you'll learn practical applications through a combination of:

- Theoretical foundations and conceptual understanding
- Hands-on exercises with real-world data
- Best practices for implementation
- Strategies for analyzing and interpreting results

The curriculum covers the complete MOSAIKS workflow:

- Accessing and processing satellite imagery
- Understanding MOSAIKS feature extraction
- Working with the MOSAIKS API
- Implementing machine learning models
- Quantifying and communicating uncertainty
- Applying models to various contexts
- Working with survey data

Whether you're new to MOSAIKS or looking to deepen your expertise, this course provides the tools and knowledge needed to effectively utilize this powerful framework.
