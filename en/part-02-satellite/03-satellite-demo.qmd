## Overview

This demonstration will show you a few key concepts about satellite data and how it can be prepared for featurization (featurization covered in @sec-features-computing). 

## Demonstration data

For this demonstration, we will use satellite imagery from the NICFI Basemaps. The NICFI Basemaps are a collection of high-resolution satellite images that are freely available for research purposes. These data come with atmospheric correction, cloud correction, and normalized pixel values. After Products created after April 2022 also apply a sharpening filter to the images. 

More details about NICFI Basemap processing can be found [here](https://assets.planet.com/docs/NICFI_Basemap_Spec_Addendum.pdf).

To learn how to access NICFI Basemaps, follow the [sign up instructions here](https://www.planet.com/nicfi/).

## Demonstration code

Below is a link to a Jupyter notebook intended to demonstrate practical preparation of satellite data for use in MOSAIKS. The notebook will guide you through the process of preparing imagery, including:

1. Loading satellite imagery

1. Inspecting image properties

1. Image normalization

1. Image visualization

## What's next? 

Now that we have covered the basics of working with satellite data, we will move on to the next section, where we will discuss image featurization.

# Looking forward

This is the end of the satellite data section. Next, we will move on to the featurization of satellite data.
