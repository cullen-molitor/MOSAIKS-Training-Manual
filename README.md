## About this manual

**<ins>M</ins>ulti-task <ins>O</ins>bservation using <ins>SA</ins>tellite <ins>I</ins>magery & <ins>K</ins>itchen <ins>S</ins>inks** (MOSAIKS) is a project that aims to make satellite imagery more accessible to researchers and practitioners. Learn more about the project [here](https://mosaiks.org/), or get started by accessing the training manual [here](https://cullen-molitor.github.io/MOSAIKS-Training-Manual/).

This repository contains the source code for the [MOSAIKS Training Manual](https://cullen-molitor.github.io/MOSAIKS-Training-Manual/), a comprehensive guide designed to help researchers and practitioners effectively utilize MOSAIKS (Multi-task Observation using Satellite Imagery & Kitchen Sinks).

The manual serves as both a reference guide and a practical tutorial, covering:

- Theoretical foundations of MOSAIKS
- Accessing and processing satellite imagery
- Working with the MOSAIKS API
- Implementing machine learning models
- Understanding uncertainty
- Best practices for implementation
- Survey data integration

## Target audience

This manual is particularly valuable for:

- Academics and researchers
- Development practitioners
- Environmental scientists
- Policy analysts
- Anyone interested in leveraging satellite imagery for socioeconomic and environmental analysis

## Technical details

The book is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and includes:

- Interactive code examples
- Practical exercises
- Real-world applications
- Comprehensive documentation
