## Course structure

This course is designed as an intensive two-week program that combines lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on sessions. Each day is structured as follows:

| **Time**       | **Activity**       |
|----------------|--------------------|
| 9:00 - 10:30   | Morning Session 1  |
| 10:30 - 11:00  | Break              |
| 11:00 - 12:30  | Morning Session 2  |
| 12:30 - 1:30   | Lunch              |
| 1:30 - 3:00    | Afternoon Session 1|
| 3:00 - 3:30    | Break              |
| 3:30 - 4:30    | Afternoon Session 2|
| 4:30 - 5:00    | Feedback and Development |

Each day concludes with a Q&A and feedback session from 4:30-5:00, providing opportunities to clarify concepts and share ideas. It is expected that this first course will spur many new ideas and concepts which should be included in the future trainings. Please remember to take notes throughout each day with particular emphasis in areas you think could be explained better or that need additional topics covered. These can be areas that you struggled with or that you would anticipate could be difficult for others.
